# The book of Grimoire

Grimoire is a programming language written in D intended to be embedded into applications which need a fexible script system simple to use.

The language features static typing, concurrency and an easy to use API to define your own types, functions and variables directly from D.

This guide assumes you have a basic understanding of at least one other programming language.

This guide is based on the version 0.8 of grimoire.

```grimoire
